// Entry point: 初始化模块并启动功能
// Keep a small compatibility layer: delegate to the autodetect content loader.
// New split modules were added: content-autodetect and per-site entry points.
import './content-autodetect'

// Note: the old logic is intentionally left in git history; new modules live under the same folder.
